                I am  a computer science graduate interested in Backend Development. 
                I am currently exploring Reactjs (This web site is built using react).
                Most of the times, I use Nodejs, MongoDB and Expressjs for building APIs. 
                But I do not constrain to this and would change to other stack based on the project requirement.
                As you can see, I am not very good at CSS. I am open for suggestions to improve the aesthetics.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Home;
